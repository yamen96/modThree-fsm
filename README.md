## Description

An implementation of a Finite Automation (FA) / Finite State Machine (FSM) in Typescript. You can find the implementation in `src/fsm.ts` and an example using the `FiniteStateMachine` class in `src/modThree.ts`. The `modThree` example computes the remainder when the given value is divided by three. The given value is a string of ones and zeroes representing an unsigned binary integer and uses the FSM implementation to find the result.
